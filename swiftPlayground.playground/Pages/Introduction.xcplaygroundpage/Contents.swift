# Introduction: Coffee and Algorithms
 
This is the structure Swift Playground notebook that will tell a story of graphs.
 Also, it is better to learn in context with many connections, as we don't want to

 From Leetcode there is a very nice description of graphs and representations
 at in their interview crash course page on [Trees and graphs](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcodes-interview-crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms/707/traversals-trees-graphs/4721/)
