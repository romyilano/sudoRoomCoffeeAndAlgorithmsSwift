 # Power in Representation
 
 [Leetcode makes a nice point](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leetcodes-interview-crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms/707/traversals-trees-graphs/4721/) that compared to linked lists and
 trees, graphs are much more abstracted. It's up to you to represent them how you want, and there is not a strict definition of showing `Node` data structures in code the way there are for other problems.
 
 
 ## Ways graph algorithms are given
 
 * there are `n` cities labeled from `0` to `n-1`
 * sometimes they won't even mention it's a graph and you have to figure that out for yourself
